# sc-shell-example

This repository is intended to be used as an example git workflow for 
use in a Software Carpentry git lesson.

Students should start off with no knowledge of this repository, and should download and extract the 
[1-initial-commit](https://github.com/strootman/sc-shell-example/archive/1-initial-commit.zip) archive file. 

Next, the students should be walked through through the scripts, as this provides 
good review from the Shell lesson. 

Then, the students should perform the following exercises, one at a time;
1. Execute the `setupProject.sh` script, then commit results.
1. Mv all shell scripts to the `code/` directory, then commit results.
1. Execute the `code/cleanData.sh` script, then commit results.
1. Execute the `code/combine.sh` script, then commit results.

Additionally, the steps above can also be combined with _pushes_ to a remote repo.

Each exercise provides many opportunities to teach aspects of a git and/or github workflow.
